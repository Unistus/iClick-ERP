## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Brand Color: The distinct `#008080` (Teal) will be used for headers, primary action buttons, and to highlight active navigation states, embodying a modern enterprise aesthetic.
- Secondary/Accent Color: A vibrant `#f26728` (Safety Orange) is reserved for critical actions such as 'Complete Sale,' 'Process Payroll,' and urgent alerts, ensuring immediate visual prominence.
- Deep Accent Colors: Darker teal shades, `#006666` and `#004c4c`, form the foundational backdrop for sidebars and navigation elements, establishing a rich, dark-mode inspired environment.
- Soft Accent Colors: Gentle `#b2d8d8` and `#66b2b2` are employed for hover states, subtle card backgrounds, and secondary badges, offering visual softness and user feedback.
- Neutral/Borders: A clear `#bfbfbf` (Silver/Gray) provides structure for dividers, visually separates disabled fields, and defines form borders for crisp, organized layouts.
- Scheme: The application will adopt a 'Modern Enterprise' dark-mode aesthetic, utilizing the deep teal color palette to create a sophisticated, high-performance visual experience that supports both brand identity and user readability.
- Headline Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for its modern, tech-savvy appearance, perfectly suited for module titles and key information blocks. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for all body text, forms, and data tables due to its excellent readability, neutrality, and clean appearance, essential for an information-dense ERP system. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employ a comprehensive set of crisp, vector-based line icons across all modules. Icons should be clear, intuitive, and consistent in style to ensure immediate understanding of actions and categories within the 'Modern Enterprise' aesthetic.
- A card-based UI layout featuring 8px rounded corners for all interactive elements and content containers, contributing to a soft yet modern visual appeal. Navigation will be managed via a retractable sidebar for ERP modules and a simplified top-bar for POS operations.
- Implement subtle transition animations for state changes and module navigation to enhance the perceived performance and user experience, avoiding abrupt visual shifts.
